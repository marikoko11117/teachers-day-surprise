            7: `Hi maam Rio,

On this special day of Teachers' Day🤍, I want to take a moment to express how thankful I am for the incredible impact you have had on my life.🧸

You have not only taught me the subjects you specialize in, but you have also taught me the value of hard work💪, the importance of kindness🙇🏻‍♀️, and the power of knowledge🧠. Your simple compliments in my work, has made me to strive more to be better. And those encouragement that no one has ever told me before may seem little to you, but it actually means a lot to me.🥹

            8: `Dear ma'm rio, 

before I greet you, first I do just want to say thankyou first. Thankyou sa very very long pasensya mo sa'mon and thankyou for being our second mother. You're the type of teacher that is easily to approach and never failed to help. 

I remember my firstday, it's so really obvious ang personality type mo as a teacher and btw this is my first encounter sng adviser nga very young. I feel so very lucky to have you as my adviser. Though the people in the room is kinda messy because of late, personality that is kinda foul, and sometimes lack of respect, but still you're here always in front of us speaking/teaching confidently.  Sometimes I think about to put myself in your place and to face 30 naughty students. I care for what you feel ma'm! Always.  HAPPY TEACHERS DAY!!!! TO THE PRETTIEST ADVISER I HAVE SO FAR!!`,

            9: `Happy Teacher's Day

Dear Ma'am Rio

I never expected to see you not only as a teacher but also as a friend. I never thought I would grow to love you as a friend and not just as an adviser. For me, you are more than just a teacher—you are a true role model. The way you teach, explain, and make lessons easy to understand has made learning such a meaningful experience for us.
I see you as an older sister who guides me not only in academics but also in life, even in giving advice about love and personal matters—even though there are supposed to be boundaries. You have become like a second family to me.
I know I'm not always the best student, and at times I may be difficult to handle, but still, I feel and appreciate how much you care. When I graduate, I know I will never forget you. You will always have a place in my heart.
I love you so much, Ma'am Rio, and I truly hope life treats you kindly—that your days are filled with more joy than hardship.`,

            10: `Hello, I know, you're having a great day and having a good time ma'am and classmates but to say the silent parts out loud...

We're all so very thankful for all the hardwork you pull out for us, just even the smallest jokes or challenges you give us always encourage us and push us in ways we can develop ourselves. I hope you take this celebration to reap your proudest moments with us, or biggest challenges.`,
